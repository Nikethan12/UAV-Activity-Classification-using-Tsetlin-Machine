# UAV-Activity-Classification-using-Tsetlin-Machine
An implementation of the activity classification of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle using Tsetlin Machine. 
### Data Preparation
The dataset is an custom image data set of 400 frequency-time images by taking micro-Doppler signatures on the mm-Wave Radar measurements data of rotating and Not-rotating drones at different radial distances from the Radar. Each image in this database is a frequency-time plot for drone activity at various ranges, preprocessed in MATLAB following the collection of raw intermediate frequency (IF) data from the Radar during the measurements.
Each image is binarised using adaptive guassian threshold.
